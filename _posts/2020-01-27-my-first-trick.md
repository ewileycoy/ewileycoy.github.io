# For my first trick
I decided to abandon anything related to blogging and try something new, both as a learning exercise and an excuse to get a fancy iPad Pro and keyboard.

IOS is a bit of a mystery to me, since I’ve been an Android user for a long time, eschewing the security and consistency for flexibility (or so I thought).

Anyhow the iPad’s learning curve—especially for how to share files—was steep for me.

Fortunately [this post](https://www.macstories.net/ios/my-markdown-writing-and-collaboration-workflow-powered-by-working-copy-3-6-icloud-drive-and-github/) really drove me to the right way to get up and running.

I knew I wanted to use github pages, since it’s free, static, and flexible (you see a theme with my thinking here?).

The combination of Working Copy and Github is pretty amazing once you get the hang of it, and I highly recommend both.
