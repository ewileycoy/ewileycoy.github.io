After years of fits and starts I should probably start a real blog. Most of the time I’m not sure if I’ve got anything interesting to say, so we’ll see. I’ve got opinions!

# Initial Thoughts
I’ll be honest, security is applied system administration. Vendors or internal teams build software, design secure methods of handling data or sessions or credentials—whatever context the application is in, but unless the finished product is actually installed and configured in a secure manner, all the development effort is for nothing.

So, understanding system and network administration should be fundamental to everyone in technical roles in information security. Developers, quality assurance, testers, risk and compliance, and everyone in between should understand that data has to come from and go to some place for it to be useful. Those comings and goings are all handled by some kind of network or system transfer.

## Lets talk about Networks
So, I’m starting a series of videos where I try to ensure everyone in InfoSec has a base level of knowledge involving networking.
Both abstract (network layers, protocol flows, etc) and concrete (subnet addressing, broadcast functionality, etc) should be understood at some level.

## Lets talk about PKI
Admittedly I’m not the worlds best PKI dude, but I’ve got some opinions on practical PKI and enterprise use.

## Lets talk about Whitelisting
I dunno if this will be more advocating than teaching. To me, whitelisting on Windows is the most fundamental and powerful control aside from removing local admin from standard users.
