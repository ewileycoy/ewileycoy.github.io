After years of fits and starts I should probably start a real blog. Most of the time I’m not sure if I’ve got anything interesting to say, so we’ll see. I’ve got opinions!

# GitHub pages
This is my first use case for a github page, so I’m still climbing the learning curve on iOS, github, Jekyll, and markdown. This blog will likely be a little ugly 😺 

# Initial Thoughts
I should share what I’m good at.

## Lets talk about Networks
So, I’m starting a series of videos where I try to ensure everyone in InfoSec has a base level of knowledge involving networking.
Both abstract (network layers, protocol flows, etc) and concrete (subnet addressing, broadcast functionality, etc) should be understood at some level.

## Lets talk about PKI
Admittedly I’m not the worlds best PKI dude, but I’ve got some opinions on practical PKI and enterprise use.

## Lets talk about Whitelisting
I dunno if this will be more advocating than teaching. To me, whitelisting on Windows is the most fundamental and powerful control aside from removing local admin from standard users.
